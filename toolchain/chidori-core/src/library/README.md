This library of methods forms the core functionality provided by Chidori.
The methods here are used to implement different cell types, which in turn form
the interface for the user to interact with a notebook editing experience.

Through code invocation it's possible for a user of Chidori to make arbitrary functions
available for execution. We provide specialized interfaces to specific functionality in order
to create rails for common operations and to make patterns used in agent applications immediately
obvious to a reader.
